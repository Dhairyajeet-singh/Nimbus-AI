Businesses often struggle to efficiently gather, analyze, and derive actionable insights from competitors' strategies and market movements. Additionally, startups and growing companies lack comprehensive intelligence on funding landscapes, investor preferences, and successful fundraising approaches. This information gap leads to missed opportunities, ineffective marketing strategies, and suboptimal business decisions.
